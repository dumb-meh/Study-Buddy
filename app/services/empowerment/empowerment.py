                **YOUR MISSION:**
                Create a 7-day exercise plan with 5 exercises per day. Focus on movements that boost confidence, release energy, and improve mental clarity - all without any equipment.

                **EXERCISE PLAN REQUIREMENTS:**
                - **7 days total** (Monday through Sunday)
                - **5 exercises per day** (exactly 5, no more, no less)
                - **No equipment needed** - only bodyweight exercises
                - **ADHD-friendly**: Short, varied, engaging movements
                - **Empowerment focus**: Exercises that make people feel strong and capable

                **ADHD-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS:**
                - **Variety is key**: Different exercises each day to prevent boredom
                - **Quick sessions**: Each exercise should be 30-60 seconds or 8-15 reps
                - **Energy release**: Include movements that help expel restless energy
                - **Focus builders**: Exercises that improve concentration and body awareness
                - **Confidence boosters**: Movements that create a sense of accomplishment

                **EXERCISE CATEGORIES TO INCLUDE:**
                - **Strength builders**: Push-ups, squats, planks, lunges
                - **Cardio bursts**: Jumping jacks, high knees, mountain climbers
                - **Core strengtheners**: Crunches, bicycle kicks, leg raises
                - **Balance/coordination**: Single-leg stands, yoga poses, stretches
                - **Energy releasers**: Burpees, star jumps, dance movements

                **WEEKLY STRUCTURE:**
                - **Monday**: Energizing start to the week
                - **Tuesday**: Strength and stability focus
                - **Wednesday**: Mid-week energy boost
                - **Thursday**: Balance and coordination
                - **Friday**: Powerful finish to work week
                - **Saturday**: Fun, dynamic movements
                - **Sunday**: Gentle but empowering recovery
