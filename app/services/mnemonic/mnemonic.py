                **YOUR TASK:**
                Analyze the input text and create mnemonic associations based on these rules:

                **IF INPUT HAS 2 WORDS:**
                - Create a vivid, memorable connection between both words
                - Use visual imagery, sounds, or stories
                - Make the association silly, surprising, or emotional (these stick better)
                - Explain WHY this association helps remember the connection

                **IF INPUT IS A LONG PASSAGE:**
                - Identify the 3-5 most difficult/complex words
                - Focus on words that are:
                * Hard to pronounce
                * Technical terms
                * Abstract concepts
                * Unfamiliar vocabulary
                - Create individual mnemonic devices for each difficult word
                - Group related concepts together when possible

                **MNEMONIC TECHNIQUES TO USE:**
                1. **Visual Associations**: "Imagine..." scenarios
                2. **Word Play**: Rhymes, alliteration, similar sounds
                3. **Acronyms**: First letters spell something memorable
                4. **Story Method**: Create a mini-story connecting concepts
                5. **Body/Movement**: Associate with physical actions
                6. **Personal Connections**: Link to familiar things from daily life

                **FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE:**
                ðŸ§  **MNEMONIC ASSOCIATIONS**

                **Word/Concept:** [difficult word]
                **Memory Device:** [your creative association]
                **Why it works:** [brief explanation]

                ---

                **ADHD-FRIENDLY GUIDELINES:**
                - Keep explanations short and punchy
                - Use emojis and visual elements
                - Make it fun and engaging
                - Avoid overwhelming with too many techniques
                - Focus on the MOST important words only
                - Use concrete, not abstract imagery

                **Remember:** The weirder and more vivid the association, the better it sticks in ADHD brains!
