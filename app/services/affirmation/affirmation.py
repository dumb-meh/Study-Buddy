                **YOUR MISSION:**
                Create a meaningful, uplifting affirmation that acknowledges ADHD strengths and addresses common struggles. Make it personal, powerful, and memorable.

                **AFFIRMATION REQUIREMENTS:**
                - **Length**: 10-25 words (easy to remember and repeat)
                - **Tone**: Positive, empowering, and understanding of ADHD experiences
                - **Focus**: Celebrate neurodivergent strengths while addressing challenges
                - **Authenticity**: Feel genuine, not generic or superficial

                **ADHD-SPECIFIC THEMES TO CONSIDER:**
                - Embracing unique thinking patterns
                - Managing overwhelm and anxiety
                - Celebrating creativity and innovation
                - Accepting imperfection and growth
                - Building self-compassion
                - Recognizing hyperfocus as a superpower
                - Honoring different energy levels
                - Validating emotional intensity
                - Encouraging persistence despite setbacks

                **MOOD-BASED ADAPTATION:**
                If user mood is provided, tailor the affirmation:
                - **Stressed/Overwhelmed**: Focus on calm, one-step-at-a-time messaging
                - **Sad/Down**: Emphasize self-worth and tomorrow's possibilities
                - **Anxious**: Center on present moment and inner strength
                - **Frustrated**: Acknowledge struggle while highlighting resilience
                - **Energetic/Good**: Celebrate momentum and channel enthusiasm
                - **Tired**: Offer gentle encouragement and self-acceptance

                **SOURCE OPTIONS:**
                1. **Famous Quote**: Use inspirational quotes from celebrities, historical figures, or thought leaders (especially those with ADHD if relevant)
                2. **Original Creation**: Craft your own affirmation specifically for this person's situation

                **OUTPUT FORMAT:**
                Provide ONLY the affirmation quote, nothing else. Format it as:

                "[The complete affirmation]" - [Author name OR "Daily Reminder"]

                **EXAMPLES OF GOOD ADHD AFFIRMATIONS:**
                - "My ADHD brain sees possibilities others miss, and that is my superpower." - Daily Reminder
                - "I am not broken; I am beautifully different and wonderfully made." - Daily Reminder  
                - "Progress, not perfection, is my goal today." - Daily Reminder

                **IMPORTANT RULES:**
                - DO NOT repeat any of the past 10 affirmations provided
                - Make it specific to ADHD experiences, not generic motivation
                - Ensure it's something they can genuinely believe and repeat
                - Keep it concise but impactful
                - Match the tone to their current mood if provided

                Create a perfect affirmation for today:"""
